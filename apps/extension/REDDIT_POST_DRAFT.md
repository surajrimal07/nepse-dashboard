## Post Body:

Hey everyone,

Been lurking here for a while. Like most of you, I got tired of the daily grind — entering CAPTCHAs on TMS, juggling multiple MeroShare accounts, refreshing the same pages over and over.

So I built a browser extension that handles most of it. Nothing fancy, just scratching my own itch. Figured some of you might find it useful too.

**What it does:**

- Auto-solves TMS CAPTCHAs and logs you in
- Handles MeroShare and NaasaX logins with credential autofill
- Multi-account management (set primary per broker, quick switch)
- Live market data in the sidepanel — index, depth, gainers/losers, supply/demand
- IPO tracker, company disclosures, odd-lot management
- Optional AI chat if you want to query market info (BYOK - bring your own API key)

**What it doesn't do:**

- No cloud sync, no external servers — everything stays on your device
- Doesn't touch your actual trades or orders
- Not affiliated with NEPSE/CDSC/TMS in any way

---

**It's open source**

The whole project is public on GitHub. Extension, backend, docs — all of it.

**Looking for contributors**

This is a side project, so progress is slow. If you're a developer (or want to learn), PRs are very welcome. Some areas where help would be great:

- Firefox support improvements
- Additional broker TMS sites testing
- UI/UX suggestions
- Documentation
- Feature ideas you'd actually use

I review and merge PRs pretty quickly. If you have a feature request, open an issue and we can discuss. Not opposed to any ideas as long as they fit the privacy-first approach.

**Install:**

- Chrome: Available on Chrome Web Store (search "Nepse Dashboard")
- Firefox: Side-load from GitHub or build from source

---

Not trying to sell anything here — it's free and will stay free. Just wanted to share something that's been useful for me. Happy to answer questions if you have any.

Cheers.

**Tags/Flair suggestion:** `Tools` or `Discussion`

## Notes for you:

- This draft is intentionally casual and matter-of-fact
- No excessive emojis or hype language
- Focuses on practical value and invites devs naturally
- Mentions limitations honestly to build trust
- The GitHub link and contributor invitation are clear without being pushy
- You might want to add a screenshot or GIF in the actual post (Reddit supports images) — showing the sidepanel or auto-login would be effective

Feel free to edit the tone further if it still feels too promotional. You know your audience best.
